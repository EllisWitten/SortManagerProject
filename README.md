# SortMangerProject

The SortManagerProject is a project which aims to design an application that allows a user to enter an array of numbers and select which sorting type they would like to use in order to sort them. The C# application will feature a small selection of methods which all uniquely sort an array in their own way. Implementing this range of diverse methods has been a challange for the team but overcoming them has enabled the team to develop some birlliant algorithms that tackle sorting arrays.
