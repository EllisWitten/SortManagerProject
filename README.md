# SortMangerProject

The SortManagerProject is a project which aims to design an application that allows a user to enter an array of numbers and select which sorting type they would like to use in order to sort them. The C# application will feature a small selection of methods which all uniquely sort an array in their own way. Implementing this range of diverse methods has been a challange for the team but overcoming them has enabled the team to develop some birlliant algorithms that tackle sorting arrays.

## SortManager Logic

    ### - MergeSort Class
    
    - The MergeSort Class has two methods, Sort and MergeSortedArrays.
    
    - The Sort method, takes in an array to split at the middle point, one half is passed to an array called leftArray, and the other to an array called rightArray. These arrays are then passed numbers in a loop before calling the Sort method again for the numbers to be organised from lowest to highest. Once the recursion has finished, both leftArray and rightArray are passed to the MergeSortedArrays method.
    
    - The MergeSortedArrays method, returns a final array back to the Sort method after merging leftArray and rightArray. This is done through a while loop that compares the lengths of each array before placing an element into the final array.
